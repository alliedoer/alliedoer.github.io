<h2>My Story...</h2>
<p class="description">
Light a fire, grab a cup of cocoa and settle in for some cozy time with Bijou!! Our pretty girl is an 8 week old, 10 lb Boxer/Hound (possibly Lab?) mix who's ready to head up to Long Island on 1/25 and would love to land her little paws in a FOSTER OR FOREVER HOME. She's always up for some fun and a few yummy treats are right up her alley. Of course the typical puppy shenanigans are inevitable but with a face like this...no one may notice!! Bijou is still a baby and would need a home where someone is around often to care for her. She is microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and adoption will be finalized upon spay. Adoption fee is $450.
