<h2>My Story...</h2>
<p class="description">
Meet Dane, a 9 week old, 7 pound (as of 1/17), adorable Lab mix. This delightful puppy is soft, sweet, cuddly and super loving.  
He is dog friendly, cat friendly and is fabulous with all humans. He seeks out attention and affection, and responds with happiness and joy. He is lively and active, but needs plenty of nap time too! Play, rest, repeat!
This tender-hearted darling has an engaging personality and is bursting with love. He is a great pup with a lot to offer. Affectionate, curious, spirited, and kind, all he needs is a home to call his own and a devoted best friend for life. 
If you would like to adopt this Rockstar, please email rescue@pupstarzrescue.org or visit www.pupstarzrescue.orgfor an application!
**Puppies are hard work. If you are not ready for a 'new baby' please adopt an adult or senior who need you! In addition, we cannot guarantee the breed, size, and age of a puppy.**

<h2>More About This Rescue!</h2>
<p>
	PupStarz Rescue is an all-volunteer animal welfare group committed to the rescue and rehabilitation of dogs and cats in public shelters at high risk of euthanasia, as well as those in danger of abuse. We are committed to rescuing as many animals as possible, saving over 1,875 dogs and cats since 2015. 
PupStarz Rescue is a foster-based rescue, relying on fosters to open their homes and lives to our Animals. Animals in our care receive proper medical care, including alteration, vaccinations, and microchipping.
Following a thorough screening, our animals are placed in loving, responsible, committed forever homes. PupStarz Rescue ensures that adoptions are an appropriate match for both the animal and their new family by educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a furry companion into their lives. 
We are committed to the welfare of our "Starz" beyond the adoption process. We maintain open communication with our adopters to ensure a smooth transition, and offer additional support such as positive training techniques. 
Founded in 2015, PupStarz Rescue is a non-profit, 501(c)3, no-kill, volunteer run animal rescue organization.
